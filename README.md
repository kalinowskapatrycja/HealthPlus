# Health+ :globe_with_meridians:
Hello and welcome to our app Health+!
Health+ is an app made for people who want to get started on focussing on their mental and physical well-being. This user-friendly application will allow employees of FDM to track their diet, fitness and be able to receive help with their mental health. They will have direct access to 30 trained mental health champions and ambassadors. This is a group project created by 7 Queen Mary University London Computer Science students (Credits below)!

## Getting Started :technologist:

## Our features :sparkles:
### Track
Track is split into 2 categories Mood and Fitness. Mood track is a functionality in which a user input how they are feeling that day and our database allows the user to access their data collected over time to see how they are emotionally doing. Similarly to fitness, the user is able to input the amount of steps they made during the day and the food they ate. Our desktop app will calculate the estimated calories the user gained or lost that day and keep this data for the user to look at in the future. This is a great form of self reflection and getting back into a routine at the end of a day.
